  "American Kestrel": {
    name: "American Kestrel",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/amkestrelsm.jpg",
    description: `The American Kestrel is the smallest and most widespread member of the falcon family. Adults have a body length of 5-12 inches and a wingspan of 20-24 inches (about the size of a Blue Jay). As with other raptors, the female is somewhat larger than the male; males typically weigh in at 2.8-3.7 ounces, whereas females can weigh up to 4.2 ounces.

    The adult male has a reddish-brown back, slate blue or gray wings, a reddish-brown breast and a white belly. The female differs with mostly brown-streaked wings and a brown-streaked white or pale buff breast. Both sexes possess the dual vertical facial "sideburns" and ocelli markings (false eyes) on the back of the head and neck. Ocelli markings may be used to confuse predators. Kestrels have amazing vision and can detect an insect up to 100 feet away. They are often seen perched on roadside utility lines or hovering above fields in search of insects or small rodents. Frequently, they can be heard uttering their "killy-killy-killy" warning and territorial call.`,
    lifeHistory: `In New York, American Kestrels begin pairing up in late March to early April. Males arrive in breeding grounds first and perform elaborate diving displays to declare their territory and attract mates. Once a pair bond is formed, the male searches for appropriate tree cavities for nesting and presents them to the female, who inspects them and makes the final selection. American Kestrels appear to favor woodpecker-excavated cavities in isolated dead trees located in the middle of large grasslands; however, they will also nest in the edges of woods, natural or man-made crevices, and nest boxes.

    Females typically lay four or five pale, rounded eggs but as many as seven have been recorded. The nest is but a shallow scrape within the selected cavity. Eggs are laid at 2-3 day intervals, incubated mostly by the female, and hatch in about 30 days. During this time, the male brings food to his mate, an activity that continues after the eggs hatch. The young are born blind with scant white down covering pale pink skin and unable to feed themselves. Nestlings grow quickly, becoming downier. The eyes open by the second or third day. After about 20 days, they begin to feed themselves and after about 30 days, their wings are fully developed and they can fledge out of the nest. Family groups can be seen hunting together for the first weeks.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `American Kestrels have a very widespread distribution. They breed throughout majority of North America, primarily south of the Arctic Circle, down into Central America and the Caribbean, as well as parts of South America. They specifically target zones where appropriate cavities are available for nesting. Seventeen subspecies are currently recognized. They breed throughout New York State, aside from the Adirondacks, Tug Hill, and parts of the Catskill and Allegheny mountains.

    Kestrels prefer open habitats such as pastures, fallow fields, and grasslands, where they can find abundant insect or other arthropod prey. New York birds migrate south in the fall. Wintering grounds resemble breeding grounds. When insects are not available, they prey on rodents, frogs, reptiles, and even smaller birds (hence the name Sparrowhawk, as they were once known).
    `,
    status: `Despite their distribution and relative abundance throughout the eastern United States, kestrel numbers have significantly and steadily declined in the past fifty years, particularly in the Northeast. Regions surrounding the Adirondack, Allegheny, and Catskills mountains, as well as suburban areas of the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island have experienced the greatest declines.

    The Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in New York State (2008) reported an overall decline of 14% in the number of atlas blocks where American Kestrels were detected breeding. This decline is consistent with that of other birds requiring open grassland habitat. These essential habitats are disappearing and becoming fragmented due to development, intensive agriculture, and plant succession.

    Human causes of mortality account for 43% of reported deaths. A significant number of reported deaths, nearly 12%, occur from collisions with vehicles. This number can be expected to rise with increased miles of roads and highways and increased travel speeds. Shooting, trapping, and direct killing account for nearly 9% of deaths reported. Also, bioaccumulation of pesticides and other contaminants may be affecting reproduction. Competition for nests by European Starlings and other aggressive birds limits available nesting sites. Natural sources of mortality include parasitism, predation, and severe weather during migrations.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `As a species that relies on grasslands and other open habitats, the fate of the American Kestrel is tied to that of other grassland birds. Since the majority of this habitat, well over 95%, occurs on private lands, conservation and management of farmland and former agricultural land is vital to their long-term survival. State and Federal agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and private landowners are participating on several initiatives to conserve and manage grassland habitat. One such conservation effort is New York's Landowner Incentive Program for Grassland Protection and Management.

    The Peregrine Fund's American Kestrel Partnership has been actively studying the breeding ecology and factors influencing the decline of the species. NYSDEC and private landowners participate in this partnership by installing and monitoring nest boxes.

  "American Bittern": {
    name: "American Bittern",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/fsambiph.jpg",
    description: `The American bittern is a medium-sized member of the Ardeidae (heron) family, weighing 0.8 to 1.1 lbs with a body length of 23.6 to 33.5 inches. This secretive marsh bird is quite distinguished with yellow, downward focused eyes and a long black streak running down the both sides of the neck. Brown upper parts and brown-and-white streaking on the neck and chest help bitterns to blend in with wetland vegetation, like cattails (Typha sp.). When they "freeze" in an alarm posture with neck and bill extended skyward, they're difficult to see while hiding in the vegetation.

    While they may be difficult to locate visually, their presence is detected by a very distinct call. Early in the breeding season, they are revealed by low, gulping "pump-er-lunk" calls that resonate throughout wetlands as males defend their territories and attempt to attract a mate.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `From mid-May to early July, the female produces a clutch of two to seven eggs which she will incubate for 24 to 28 days. After hatching, the altricial (helpless) young remain in the nest for two weeks. They remain near the nest site as they continue to be fed by adults for another two to four weeks. The majority of their diet is sourced from nutritionally-rich, diverse wetland habitat. The young are fed regurgitated food from the parents until fledging, though the precise age of fledging remains unknown.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `American bitterns return to New York in early spring to establish breeding territories in interior freshwater wetlands and occasionally coastal salt marshes. Beginning in late April, they gather dead plant material to construct platform nests. Located over standing water, the nest site is well concealed by emergent vegetation such as cattails, bur-reed (Sparganium sp.), or bulrushes (Scirpus sp.). Occasionally, nests are placed in grasslands or fields next to wetlands.

    This elusive species overwinters in wetlands along the southern Atlantic coast, throughout the Gulf coast states, west to California, and south throughout Central America. A few individuals venture as far as the Bahamas and Greater Antilles. The breeding range encompasses much of Canada and the U.S., extending from Newfoundland west to British Columbia, south to Virginia and westwards to the Pacific coast.
    `,
    status: `Historical accounts indicate that American bitterns were once common throughout New York State. Widespread wetland loss and degradation have contributed to population decline of this wetland obligate species.=

    Currently, the American bittern is considered a Species of Special Concern in New York State. It is listed as Endangered in several neighboring states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

    Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) show a declining trend throughout its range. Similarly, the 2000-2005 New York Breeding Bird Atlas revealed a ten percent decrease in distribution throughout the state since the 1980s. The American bittern population decrease in New York State is directly dependent on the population decline as they're heavily reliant on wetland habitat.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `A concrete understanding of American bittern distribution, population status, and habitat associations has been hindered by the difficulty of monitoring secretive, marsh-dwelling species. A National Marsh Bird Monitoring Program is underway to address this issue by using a targeted survey protocol to elicit responses from secretive marsh bird species.

  "American Woodcock": {
    name: "American Woodcock",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/amwoodcockhidden.JPG",
    description: `The American woodcock is one of New York's most unusual upland birds. Approximately the size of a mourning dove, an adult woodcock weighs 8-12 ounces, is 10-12 inches in length (including bill), and has a wingspan of 17-19 inches. It has a bill that looks too long for its body, and ears that are placed forward on the face, between the eyes and the bill. To help guard against predation from above, its eyes are set high on the back of the head. Its large eyes have nearly 360-degree vision - a distinct advantage when foraging in the soil. The woodcock's long bill has a flexible tip specially adapted for probing into moist soil in search of earthworms. It can eat its weight in worms each day. They also eat other invertebrates, and have been known to eat ants from ant hills during times of drought.

    The woodcock's mottled brown to black body enables this bird to blend in with the forest floor. As such, they are difficult to spot and will often startle you if you walk by them. When flushed from the ground, these birds flutter up through the thick canopy, level off over the top, and then fly away. Wind moving through their wings makes a whistling sound as they go. Although they sometimes fly considerable distances, they usually only fly short distances of 10 to 20 yards at flight speeds of up to 30 mph. Their odd appearance and behavior has inspired many local names like timberdoodle, bog sucker, mud bat, mud snipe, and Labrador twister.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `Each spring, male woodcock perform an unusual courtship ritual in an attempt to attract mates. At dusk, a male will sit on the ground in an opening or small field and repeatedly utter a low, nasal, almost insect-like 'peent.' He then takes off low and spirals upward on whistling wings to heights of 100-200 feet before spiraling back down and landing near where he took off. He makes a chirping sound during this downward spiral. Males repeat this act again and again until well after dark.

    Nesting occurs from mid-March into June. Females lay their eggs-one per day-in shallow depressions on the ground among dead leaves. Most nests have four eggs, and incubation takes approximately 21 days. The chicks are precocial (highly developed), meaning they can move around and follow the hen soon after hatching. Chicks grow very rapidly on a diet of earthworms and insects. By the time they are four weeks old, it is difficult to distinguish the chicks from adults. Male woodcock are not involved in nesting or brood rearing.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `Migratory birds, woodcock spend each spring and fall traveling between their breeding grounds in northern North America and their wintering grounds in the southern United States. They fly only at night, typically migrating at low altitudes of 50-100 feet. They may fly alone or in loose flocks called flights. If you are walking near moist thickets during these migration times, you might see signs of the woodcock: silver-dollar-shaped white splashes on the ground-the droppings or 'chalk' of these birds. Woodcock are most active at dawn and dusk, usually searching for a meal.

    The woodcock requires a diverse mix of habitats to thrive, including riparian shrublands and forests (land along riverbanks), as well as upland shrublands, early successional forests and forest thickets. Within these areas, second growth hardwoods provide important nesting habitat, while areas with thick cover and moist fertile soil with abundant worms are used as feeding grounds. In addition, the woodcock uses new clear-cuts, large fields or pastures for night roosting, and males need small openings in the forest to sing over.
    `,
    status: `Woodcock populations have been declining in the eastern United States for several decades. Annual spring surveys of their breeding grounds show that woodcock numbers in the eastern flyway and in New York have been falling by about 2 percent since the 1960s-a loss of over 55 percent in the last 40 years. As a result, national and international bird conservation organizations consider the American woodcock a species of continental concern, and protecting the woodcock is a high priority in its habitat ranges.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `The woodcock's decline is attributed to loss of upland and wetland habitat due to development, succession, and forest maturation. In addition, the reduction in forestry practices, especially in riparian areas which are critical for breeding and migrating woodcock, also contributes to the loss in woodcock numbers. Woodcock depend on trees and shrubs that require full sunlight and open canopies. This only comes from disturbance to forests, which has been dramatically reduced by fire suppression and the reluctance to fell trees.

    This reluctance is based on the misconception that cutting trees is bad for birds and wildlife. While cutting trees can negatively impact some wildlife species, proper forest management actually increases the abundance and diversity of some birds and forest wildlife in an area. Ironically, the bird and wildlife species of mature forests, often touted as threatened, are actually doing well overall; it is the early successional species that need more help and habitat.

    DEC's Young Forest Initiative, which started in 2015, aims to dramatically increase early successional and young forest habitats for a variety of species, including American Woodcock, on Wildlife Management Areas. Fortunately, woodcock populations, as well as other early-successional-forest species, can often be readily restored through proper harvest management of forested lands. Cutting small 5-10 acre patches or strips through the forest in rotation creates a mosaic of different age forests with diverse structures. These areas provide everything the woodcock needs to survive and prosper-good cover, abundant food, and openings for singing males.

  "Bald Eagle": {
    name: "Bald Eagle",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/eagle4.jpg",
    description: `The bald eagle was adopted as the symbol of the United States because of its independence and strength. One of the largest birds of prey (raptors) found in North America, bald eagles stand about 30 inches high, have a wingspan of 72-84 inches, and weigh between 8 and 14 pounds.

    This majestic bird is easily identified in adult plumage by its unmistakable brown body set off by a white head and tail and bright yellow bill (male and female eagles look identical, except that the female is usually about one third larger and heavier than the male, as is typical in birds of prey). Sexual maturity and the characteristic white head and tail are achieved at five years of age. The word bald in the eagle's name comes from a word in Old English that means white headed.

    Immature bald eagles lack the white head and tail. They are mostly chocolate brown with varying amounts of white over the body, tail, and underwings. Juvenile bald eagles are often mistaken for immature golden eagles, which are much rarer in New York.

    Despite their fierce image, bald eagles are actually quite timid and opportunistic. Since their primary prey is fish, bald eagles are sometimes called sea eagles, though they will take some mammals, waterfowl, seabirds, and carrion, especially during winter.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `The bald eagle is a long-lived bird, with a life span in the wild of more than 30 years. Bald eagles mate for life, returning to nest in the general area (within 250 miles) from which they fledged. Once a pair selects a nesting territory, they use it for the rest of their lives.

    Bald eagles' aerial courtship is an amazing display of avian abilities. The pair soars high in the sky, begins a dive, and interlocks talons while descending in a series of somersaults. Bald eagles produce only one or two offspring per year, rarely three. In New York, the young fledge by mid to late summer at about 12 weeks of age. By 20 weeks they are largely independent.

    A bald eagle nest is a large structure, usually located high in a tall, live white pine tree near water. The nest is reused and added to (decorated) each year, often becoming eight or more feet deep, six feet across, and weighing hundreds of pounds.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `Bald eagles are wholly North American, and currently are found in every state except Hawaii, as well as throughout Canada. Eagles prefer undisturbed areas near large lakes and reservoirs, marshes and swamps, or stretches along rivers where they can find open water and their primary food, fish.

    Historically, bald eagles nested in forests along the shorelines of oceans, lakes or rivers throughout most of North America, often moving south in winter to areas where water remained open. Prior to the 1900s, they used as many as 80 nest sites in New York, primarily in the northern and western parts of the state.

    Wintering grounds are from southern Canada south, along major river systems, in intermountain regions, and in the Great Plains. Many hydroelectric plants, including some in New York, provide suitable wintering habitat for bald eagles.
    `,
    status: `Bald eagles have always been seen as competitors with humans for important wild food sources and as threats to farm animals-at one time, bounties were even offered for killing them.

    In the last century, reproductive impairment from pesticides (especially DDT) and heavy metals caused virtual extirpation of the few remaining bald eagles in New York and many other areas. Persistent and toxic compounds in fish from contaminated waters built up to high levels in the eagles' bodies, interfering with the deposition of calcium in their eggshells and making many of the eggs infertile.

    Since the 1972 ban on DDT, eagles and other birds of prey are once again producing young. However, there has been no reduction in the human activity most damaging to eagle populations - destruction of habitat by logging and development along watercourses. Even recently, extensive human activity within preferred eagle habitats has disturbed important nest areas, resulting in reproductive failure and nest abandonment.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `The New York State Bald Eagle Restoration Project began in 1976 in an attempt to reestablish a breeding population through hacking (hand rearing to independence). Over a 13 year period, 198 nestling bald eagles were collected (most from Alaska), transported and released in New York.

    The hacking project ended in 1989, when it accomplished its goal of establishing ten breeding pairs. The bald eagle program's focus has now shifted to finding and protecting nesting pairs in New York, and monitoring their productivity. Bald eagles continue to do well; in 2010 New York had 173 breeding pairs which fledged 244 young. Each year, New York's bald eagles fledge about 10 percent more young eagles than the year before.

    Hopes are high that bald eagles will continue to expand in New York and elsewhere, repopulating areas from which they have disappeared. In the meantime, our challenge is to secure sufficient suitable eagle habitat and to limit human disturbance within these habitats, allowing the species to continue to live and expand in New York.

  "Bicknell's Thrush": {
    name: "Bicknell's Thrush",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/fsbithph.gif",
    description: `Previously thought to be a sub-species of the gray-cheeked thrush (Catharus minimus), the Bicknell's thrush was recognized as a distinct species in 1995. It is a small- to medium-sized thrush, measuring 6 to 7 ½ inches with olive to brown upper parts and gray or white under parts with a heavily-spotted breast. Sexes are similar. When compared with the gray-cheeked thrush, the Bicknell's is smaller in size with more yellow on the lower mandible and contrasting chestnut color on tail and wings. It prefers dense understory and thick tangles of brush or thicket.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `The Bicknell's thrush is an elusive, neotropical migrant that breeds in the high elevation forests of Northeastern North America and winters in the Caribbean. Males arrive on the breeding grounds before females.

    Both sexes mate with multiple partners and each nest contains eggs fathered by different males. Males are not territorial but will compete for mating rights with females. Nest construction by the female occurs in a dense stand of young spruce or fir. The nest is a cup of twigs and mosses placed at the base of a group of branches against the trunk of a small tree. The clutch of 3 to 4 eggs is incubated by the female for 9 to 14 days. Young hatch almost bare but reach adult weight by the time they leave the nest, 9 to 13 days post hatching. Both parents share in feeding the young. Diet consists of insects and other invertebrates found close to ground level. They forage by hopping along the forest floor and making short flights among the low branches of trees.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `The Bicknell's thrush is an eastern nearctic species with a very geographically limited breeding range that extends from the northern Gulf of the St. Lawrence and Nova Scotia, south through the mountains of New England and New York. It is a habitat specialist restricted to mountainous forests of balsam fir.

    In New York, the Bicknell's thrush breeds at high elevations in the Adirondack and Catskill mountains which represent the southern-most boundary of its breeding range. Because of its preference for stands of dense fir on ridgelines, the Bicknell's thrush is often associated with recently disturbed areas characterized by standing dead conifers and dense regrowth of balsam fir.
    `,
    status: `First discovered by Eugene Bicknell on Slide Mountain in the Catskills in 1881, this thrush is endemic to northeastern North America. The Bicknell's thrush is of high conservation priority because of its small population, limited breeding and wintering ranges, and vulnerability to deforestation in its winter habitat. Population data are difficult to gather because of the species' limited range and elusive breeding habits. Total population is thought to be less than 50,000 individuals. The significant geographic and habitat limitations of this species breeding range may make it vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `Further research is needed to determine population characteristics as well as the distribution and extent of Bicknell's thrush breeding habitat in northeastern mountain forests. Little is known of Bicknell's thrush breeding and wintering ecology. Mercury pollution and acid deposition have contributed to the degradation of high elevation forests in the northeast since the 1960s and 1970s. Designation of the Catskills and Adirondack High Peaks Important Bird Areas by the Audubon Society offers some habitat protection.

  "Black Rail": {
    name: "Black Rail",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/fsblraph.jpg",
    description: `The smallest of North America's rail species at six inches in length; the black rail is stocky, short-billed, short-tailed, and round-winged. It is mostly dark gray or black on the head, bill, and chest with white-speckled dark wings, back and lower abdomen. The throat of the female is pale gray or white, while the throat of the male is pale to medium gray. The nape and upper back is chestnut-brown and the eyes are scarlet red. Their breeding season call is a three-noted "kickee-doo" or "kic-kic-ker." Immature black rails are similar in appearance to the adults but with less distinct spotting and streaking on the body. Another feature in juvenile black rails are the eyes which are amber to hazel until they turn red at three months old.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `The extent of migration in this species is poorly understood. Individuals have been recorded in winter as far north as New Jersey; however, it is likely that most east coast populations migrate south. Spring migration occurs from mid-March to May. Peak nesting occurs from June to mid-July. The nest is concealed in grasses and is woven together with live and dead vegetation. It has a deep cup shape with a canopy over top with an entrance ramp leading up the side. A clutch of 6 to 10 buffy white eggs with brown spots is incubated for 16 to 20 days. Both sexes share incubation and brood rearing duties suggesting a monogamous relationship, but it is unknown whether the pair bond lasts longer than one breeding season. Chicks are hatched one at a time and are semiprecocial (born at a semi-advanced state). The degree of parental care and chick survival is unknown. Fall migration occurs in September to mid-October.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `Black rails breed locally in California, Kansas, and along the Atlantic coast from southern New England to the Gulf coast states. They winter from the southern Atlantic coast, south to Central America. Historically, the breeding range may have extended as far north as Massachusetts but today the core breeding range is from New Jersey south along the coast to Florida. In the late 1930s, breeding locations in New York were limited to just a few sites on Long Island's south shore (Oak Beach marsh, Long Beach and Lido Beach). However, from the 1940s to 1968 no breeding activity was recorded at these sites or anywhere else in the state. In 1968, black rails were once again confirmed breeding at Oak Beach marsh with the discovery of two nesting pair. During the 2nd New York State Breeding Bird Atlas (2000-2005), a single bird was heard calling from the marsh.

    Black rails nest on the higher ground portions of coastal salt and brackish marshes dominated by rushes, grasses, and sedges. They have also been documented less frequently in wet meadows and freshwater emergent marshes. The single remaining breeding location in New York is dominated by saltmeadow cordgrass and spikegrass interspersed with shallow pools of water.
    `,
    status: `The black rail population has been declining in the eastern United States for over a century and some reports suggest that the population may have decreased by as much as 75% in just the last 10-20 years. It has likely been extirpated from the northern extent of its range in Connecticut and Massachusetts and the number of nesting locations and individuals within its core range has decreased to very low numbers.

    Population declines are likely attributable to increasing development in coastal areas that has resulted in habitat loss and degradation of breeding areas. Black rails build nests in the high ground areas of coastal marshes because they are less prone to flooding than lower-lying areas; however, those characteristics also make it ideal for residential and commercial development. In addition, many remaining salt marshes are in close proximity to development and are subject to many factors that reduce habitat quality:

    In an effort to control mosquito populations drain water is often ditched. This management practice also reduces the abundance and diversity of other invertebrates, which are the black rail's food base.

    Predators, such as raccoons, cats, and rats, occur at higher densities near human development than in wild areas. Due to their high-marsh habitat, black rails may be more prone to mammalian nest predation than more interior-marsh nesting species.

    Soil is often contaminated with PCBs, heavy metals and pesticides. Birds that feed on prey from contaminated soil may have lower reproductive success and higher mortality than birds in less polluted wetlands.

    Invasive species, such as Phragmites, often crowd out native vegetation and form dense monoculture stands. The diversity of wildlife is drastically reduced at sites once taken over by Phragmites. It is unlikely that black rails can utilize marshes dominated by Phragmites and these stands represent a further loss of black rail habitat.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `The future of the black rail is uncertain. Despite very low population numbers, the black rail is not protected by federal listing as threatened or endangered. It is also unprotected in many of the states within its southern range; however, it is listed as endangered in most of the Mid-Atlantic states. The biggest threat may be yet to come if sea levels rise as a result of climate change. Climate change model predictions suggest that the low-lying habitat of this species will likely be among the first areas inundated.

    Little is known about black rails, due to its secretive nature and rareness. Additional research on this species is needed in all areas of biology. Current research along the east coast is focusing on assessing the black rail population and developing a conservation action plan aimed at increasing the population throughout its range.

  "Black Skimmer": {
    name: "Black Skimmer",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/blsk.jpg",
    description: `Black skimmers are a medium-sized, sexually-dimorphic species with size differences between males and females easily noticeable. Adults range in size from approximately 15.5-19.5 inches in length with a wingspan of approximately 14-15 inches. Adult skimmers weigh between 8-12.8 ounces. Black skimmers are easily identifiable with predominant black markings on the top half of their bodies and white below. Skimmers have bright reddish orange colored webbed feet. Juvenile skimmers by contrast are mottled brown and black on top and off-white underneath.

    Perhaps the most noticeable feature of the black skimmer is its uniquely shaped bill. The skimmer bill is approximately 2-2.5 inches long with the lower mandible obviously longer than the upper, often by as much as an inch. However, during early juvenile development both upper and lower mandibles are the same length. Colored bright reddish orange at the base and black at the tip, the bill is compressed laterally and is reminiscent of a knife blade. This unique feature of black skimmer is an evolutionary adaptation to its feeding and foraging behavior. Black skimmer calls are often described as a bark.
    `,
    lifeHistory: `Black skimmers are a migratory species. During the early spring black skimmers leave their southern wintering habitat and begin to migrate northward along the eastern coast. Black skimmer arrival in New York State begins during the last week of April and into early May. After nesting and breeding during the summer months, juveniles and adults will often stay and loaf along New York's coast into the fall. Migration back to wintering grounds usually occurs during October and into November however, skimmer have been known to stay in New York as late as December.

    Black skimmers prefer to nest upon beaches, salt marsh islands, dredge spoil islands, and sand bars and nest primarily along the southern coast of Long Island. Black skimmer nests are simply a small scrape or depression on the beach or within a wrack deposit. Initial egg laying for skimmer usually occurs between mid-May and early June, however late arrivals or re-nesting skimmers may be outside of that window. Eggs are usually laid on successive or every other day intervals and a typical nest contains three to four (3-4) eggs with two and five egg nests being rare. Incubation of the eggs requires between 21 - 26 days and both parents share the responsibility.

    Black skimmers forage in shallow tidal waters often found in the back of bays and tidal inlets. Foraging usually occurs during low tide or at night. Black skimmers do exactly that when they forage, they literally skim the surface of the water with their bill partially submerged. Upon coming into contact with a potential food item the skimmer reflexively snaps its bill closed capturing the object.

    In New York skimmer are most likely to feed on:

    silversides
    killifish
    menhaden
    bluefish
    sand lance
    needlefish
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `The North American race of black skimmer (Rynchops niger niger) relies almost entirely upon marine resources for both nesting habitat as well as for forage. Located primarily within the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico during the winter months black skimmer migrate northward beginning in early Spring to breed. The species migrates along both the east and west coasts. Migrants along the east coast arrive in New York in early April and select barrier beaches, salt marsh, and dredge spoil islands as nesting habitat. Except for a small group that continues on into Massachusetts, New York often represents the northern breeding limit of this species.

    In New York black skimmer almost always form mixed species colonies with either least or common terns. The two largest colonies in New York are located only 17 miles apart and are found in Breezy Point, Queens and on Nickerson Beach in Nassau County.

    status: `Currently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does not list black skimmer as threatened or endangered. However, it is protected as a Species of Special Concern in New York State. The primary reason for the Special Concern ranking is the limited number of breeding colonies in New York. The annual number of black skimmer colonies is approximately ten. However, the majority of successfully nesting birds are located at only two sites. The annual population of black skimmer is highly variable, but typically averages 490 adult pairs in New York.

    Primary concerns for this species center around conflicting or competing use of limited coastal resources with human development and recreation, predation to adults, eggs, and hatchlings by both wild and domestic animals, and changing climatic variables.

    managementAndResearchNeeds: `Symbolic fencing, beach maintenance, and other endangered species management actions designed to benefit the piping plover often encapsulate black skimmer nesting habitat as well.

    Black skimmers are currently surveyed annually as part of the Long Island Colonial Waterbird and Piping Plover (LICWPP) survey. While this survey provides a reference for annual abundance and distribution it does not provide any measure of breeding productivity. The recently developed species conservation guide for the black skimmer calls for increasing the number of annual breeding locations coupled with a larger geographic range of stable colonies, while at least maintaining the number of breeding adults annually.

    Research needs are centered on understanding marsh loss occurring along New York's coast and the potential for providing alternate breeding locations such as rooftop nesting which has shown to be beneficial to terns in southern states.

  "Black Tern": {
    name: "Black Tern",
    image: "https://www.dec.ny.gov/images/wildlife_images/fsblteph.jpg",
    description: `The black tern is a small member of the Laridae family at approximately 10 inches in length and 1.75-2 ounces in weight. It is identifiable in the breeding season by its jet black feathers on the head and body, the back fading to gray on the rump. The bill is nearly as long as the head and is bluish with a trace of dark red at the gape; the feet are also dark red. The upper wings and tail are uniformly gray, aside from white lesser wing coverts which form a small white shoulder when the bird is at rest. During the winter, black feathers fade to gray on the back and turn white on the underparts. Juvenile black terns are similar to the adult in winter plumage, but have barred wing coverts and are generally scalloped brown overall. The call of this bird is a shrill, metallic "krik."

    lifeHistory: `In early May, black terns return to New York from the wintering range and begin their courtship displays at communal feeding and resting areas. Mating pairs are established by mid to late May when they disperse to nesting areas in typically large (≥ 49 acres) "hemi-marshes" (50/50 ratio of open water to emergent vegetation). Nest-site selection and building is rapid. In approximately four days, black terns build shallow, cup-like nests upon floating substrates of matted, dead marsh vegetation, old muskrat houses, cattail rootstalks, emergent vegetation mats of algae, or fallen logs.

    The single brood consists of 2-4 eggs. Both parents attend the nest and continually add nesting materials during the incubation period of 21 days. The chicks are able to swim, walk and run within two days of hatching and they fledge in 21-24 days.
    `,
    distributionAndHabitat: `The black tern is a semi-colonial waterbird that nests on inland marsh complexes, ponds, mouths of rivers and shores of large lakes. In North America, the breeding range extends from Central British Columbia, east across the prairie provinces to Central Ontario and Southern Quebec, and south to Central California, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Northern New York, and Northern New England. The black tern winters in marine and coastal areas of Central America and Northern South America.

    In New York, black tern breeding colonies once occurred at 56 sites along the southern and eastern shores of Lake Ontario from Niagara Falls to Watertown, in marshes along the St. Lawrence River and inland marshes of Western, Central and Northwestern New York. Today, approximately 200 nesting pairs occur at less than 20 of the historic breeding sites.
    `,
    status: `Beginning in the 1960s, the black tern population declined across its range. In the 1960s, a series of dams in the St. Lawrence River were erected to generate hydropower, stabilize Lake Ontario water levels for commercial shipping, and protect shoreline real estate from flooding. These dams limited the annual fluctuation of water levels that promoted the hemi-marsh conditions favored by nesting black terns, and resulted in a loss of breeding habitat.

    Regular monitoring revealed that the number of colonial nesting sites in New York State decreased between 1989 and 2004 by 57%. This is primarily attributed to habitat degradation. The 2000-2005 NYS Breeding Bird Atlas data showed 40% fewer black tern-occupied blocks than the 1980-1985 Breeding Bird Atlas. Black tern nesting habitat may be further compromised by agricultural run-off, pollution, invasive species, reduced invertebrate prey biomass, residential and commercial development, and recreational watercraft disturbance.
    `,
    managementAndResearchNeeds: `Black tern surveys are conducted every three to four years by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation staff and volunteers at historical and current nesting sites. These surveys are a critical component to monitoring the status of this declining species, and are necessary to identify factors that will improve conservation efforts and restoration of nesting sites.

    Currently, invasive species control and water level manipulations are the most effective strategies of black tern habitat management; however, both can be costly and time and labor intensive. In New York, the impact of agricultural run-off and pesticide contamination has been suggested as a compounding factor to habitat loss. Additional research focused on habitat quality, water quality, and prey populations is needed to determine the impact of habitat degradation on black tern diet and nutrition, which may be limiting successful breeding.
